# The Full DHIS2 One Health AMR data model
This DHIS2 metadata file contains the full One Health data model, inclusive of the ODS (tracker program landing points for AMR data), the Aggegate Analytics tables, and the visualisations and dashboards of priority pathogens.

__Note:__ Before importing the analytics layer, it is necessary to search and replace the placeholder national uid "replace_national_UID" with the DHIS2 UID for the organisation unit at the top the organisational tree (normally the country UID for national systems).
