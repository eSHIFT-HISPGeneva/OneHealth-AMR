The metadata file(s), when loaded into DHIS2 using standard metadata import mechanisms, instantiate a national-level end-point for cross-sector AMR surveillance. The core artifacts created include:
- Operational Data Stores (ODS) for animal, human, environmental, food, and feed domain AMR test results, in both quantiative or interpreted format;
- A set of pre-defined AMR indicators that allow dynamic querying of the ODS's (the equivalent of sector data marts);
- An aggregate AMR data cube for pouring snapshots of interpretted ODS data.
- a set of common dashboards that have been derived from input from country AMR teams.
Each subdirectory corresponds to a DHIS2 veresion. The metadata file(s) in each of those directories have been validated and tested for that version of DHIS2.
