The metadata file(s), when loaded into DHIS2 using standard metadata import mechanisms, instantiate a national-level end-point for cross-sector AMR surveillance. The core artifacts created include:
- Operational Data Stores (ODS) for animal, human, and environmental sector AMR test results, in both quantiative or interpreted format;
- A set of pre-defined AMR indicators that allow dynamic querying of the ODS's (the equivalent of sector data marts);
- A built-in set of breakpoint formuli for a core subset of priority GLASS pathogens and antimicrobrials that allow for the automatic interpretitation of quantitative results;
- An aggregate AMR data cube for pouring snapshots of interpretted (applied breakpoint) ODS data.
