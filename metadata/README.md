# metadata README
The following subdirectories provide access to all the relevant metadata files that - when loaded into their respective software components - form the basis of a starting national cross-sector One Health AMR surveillance platform. Includes:
- DHIS2 metadata packages for instantiating the surveillance end-point for a national system
- Open Interop interoperability mapping files for configuring connectors between tested data sources and the interoperability layer and the DHIS2 surveillance end-point.
- R scripts for extracting line-listing data from operational data stores in DHIS2 and aggregating them for insertion into interpreted analtical and reporting data cubes.
- GLASS scripts for extracting summary results from DHIS2 and generating a separate GLASS compatiable report file for submission to GLASS.
