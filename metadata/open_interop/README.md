This One Health AMR repository has been tested in two different countries with different interoperability components to ensure the portability of the concept to different providers of middleware. This subdirectory provides the metadata configuration files for OpenInterop, an open-source lightweight interoperability component maintained by the [Software for Health Foundation](https://softwareforhealth.org/our-software/open-interop). The source files and documentation for this component is available at [on GitHub](https://github.com/open-interop).
